# Red-Black-Tree
This program implements a Red-Black Tree, a self balancing binary search tree.

## Features
- Insert nodes with automatic balancing and coloring
- Delete nodes while maintaining tree properties
- Inorder traversal

## Usage
- Insert keys interactively
- Print the tree structure
- Delete keys by value

## How it works
The tree maintains balance by enforcing Red-Black properties via rotations and recoloring during insertions and deletions.
